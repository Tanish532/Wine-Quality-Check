# Wine-Quality-Check
Wine quality detection using machine learning is a problem of predicting the quality of wine based on the chemical properties of the wine. This problem is approached as a regression problem where the goal is to predict the wine quality score on a scale of 0-10 based on different chemical properties, such as acidity, pH, residual sugar, alcohol content, etc.

To solve this problem, a dataset containing the training examples is used to train a machine learning model. This dataset consists of a collection of features (the chemical properties of the wine) and the corresponding quality score of the wine. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the quality score of new wine samples by using their features.

There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for wine quality detection, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and neural network regression. The performance of these algorithms can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, or R-squared. Hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering can also be used to improve the performance of the machine learning model.
